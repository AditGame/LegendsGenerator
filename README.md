# Legends Generator

Creates the history of a world one step at a time.

ðŸš§ This library is very WIP. Any item with ðŸš§ next to it is still a work in progress and may not be done yet.

Don't rely on literally anything staying static here until we hit version 1.0.

## Description

The legends generator uses an initial state of the world to advance the history of the world, returning a copy of the world advanced by one Step.

## Definitions

* Step: The smallest unit of calculated time. Subdivision of this time, from a historical perspective, is not possible. Typically a step should be approx one week, however the exact value is by convention of the Definition files.
* World: A state of the world at any given step. The world state will cloned by the history generator in a Step. Each Step has it's own distinct world.
* Grid: The world is subdivided into a grid of squares. Each square is the smallest subdivision of position. Typically this is 1 mile.
* Square: A single X/Y on the grid, the smallest subdivision of space.
* Thing: A thing is anything (square of land, building, lake, person, notable crocodile, army division) which occurs on the map.
* Attribute: Each Thing has a list of attributes, which are string:int pairs. These attributes are free form and are used to define what the thing is. Typically attributes are modified by Effects which change the attribute value in a timed perspective, however direct modification of the attribute is certainly possible. These are typically things like health, strength, population.
* Aspect: ðŸš§ Each thing has a list of aspects, which are string:string pairs. These aspects define what the thing is, an are set instead of modified. These are things like race or gender.
* Event: Events describe change in the world. Each event has a subject, 0-to-n objects, and effects. Events are randomly generated during the Step generation process and applied to the Things on the map.
* Forced Event: ðŸš§ These events are injected into the world state for the next generation process to evaluate, preferring them over all other possible events ensuring they occur. These are used to model player interactions into the world so their effects occur naturally on the world stage.
* Effect: An effect of an event describes the change in the world. They modify an attribute/aspect, create/destroy/change a Thing, start movement, or a variety of other things. Any effect can do any number of things, an event can thus have massive effects on multiple things on the map.
* Definition: Define how things are generated in the world. There are two major types:
   * Thing Definition: Define randomly created initial values for a given thing, as well as other static parts of the generated thing.
   * Event Definition: Defines an event, who is involved in the event, the effects of the event, and the chances of the event occurring.
* Condition: Used extensively in Definitions, are code snippets evaluated at runtime.

### Thing Types

There are multiple types of things with small but essential differences between them.

* Site (eg City, Town, Tower, lake, city): a static location on the map which does not move.
* Structure (eg Pub, University): ðŸš§ A building inside of a site.
   * This may change in the future. A pub within a site should be considered the same as a pub within a city in many contexts, so the differentiation may be removed.
* Notable Person (eg Settler, Mayor): A person who can move around the map.
* Unit (eg Military Unit): ðŸš§ A collection of something. Units are typically (but not always) lead by a notable person.
* Artifact (eg Magic Ring): ðŸš§ An object which can be held by somebody, typically conferring an effect to that person.


## Tools

There are tools available for the development of Definition files.
* Editor: Allows easy editing and some validation of the definition files.
* Viewer: Allows viewing of the world state, specifically designed to play with the world as you develop the definition files.

Combined these tools comprise a very simple IDE for development of the Definition files.

## Basic use

There are 3 things needed to start the generator:

* A directory full of Definition json files.
* An initial world state.
* A condition compiler (We provide a C# one with LegendsGenerator.Compiler.CSharp). This needs to match the conditions you use in your Definition json files.

Once you have those three things, you can iterate the world state as much as you'd like to obtain a new world state.

```csharp
// Initialize your choice of condition compiler.
ConditionCompiler processor = new ConditionCompiler(new Dictionary<string, object>());

// Select the directory full of definitions.
string definitionsDirectory = "Definitions";

// Initialize the history generator.
HistoryGenerator history = new HistoryGenerator(definitionsDirectory, process);

// Create some initial world state (in this case, an empty world).
World world = new World()
{
    WorldSeed = worldSeed,
    Grid = new LegendsGenerator.Grid(20, 20),
};

// Iterate the world state to step 2, using the definitions.
World world2 = history.Step(world);

// Iterate again, to step 3
World world3 = history.Step(world2);
```

## Intended use

* Create a initial world, like Civilization. Throw some settlers on a map.
* Run the process several hundred times to create a world with an interesting back story
* Drop a player in the world. Use the World data to fill the world with people, places, and things.
* If the player does something notable, like kill a notable person or burn down a town, create a Forced Event.
* Periodically run the HistoryGenerator to advance the world stage, preferably at a point when the game is otherwise paused (player is asleep, perhaps).
* Modify the world based on the new world state.

## Notes

* The world is cloned in each step, you should retain the old world for history.
* All events occur "at once", with all calculations occurring on the old objects but effects being applied to the resultant object.
   * There is one exception, which is destruction. If a thing is destroyed it will not be considered as Objects, nor will it pick any events for this Step.
